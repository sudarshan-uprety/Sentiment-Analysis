# Sentiment-Analysis
This is second project og my data science intern @CodeClause.
Here I have use 1.6 million tweets to do sentiment analysis and the data was pulled through kaggle.
I have used different NLP method to clean and preprocess the data and finally use LogisticRegression to train my model.
The zip file is because git doesnot let me upload file size more than 100mb so I have compressed and upload it.
